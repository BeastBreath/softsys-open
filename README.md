# Software Systems (Open Version)

This repository contains the material for all assignments and course meetings
used in the Software Systems (SoftSys) course at Olin College. This
includes assignment writeups, starter files, and rubrics, as well as lecture
slides. (Note that some days were dedicated to project check-ins and did not
have slides.)

The materials are intended to be used in conjunction with the course texts,
which are [Head First
C](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-c/9781449335649/), [Think
OS](https://greenteapress.com/thinkos/), and [The Little Book of
Semaphores](https://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/). If on Windows, you are
expected to have followed the computational setup instructions on our course
website (https://softsys.olin.edu), or to have a suitably equivalent setup for
writing and running C code.
